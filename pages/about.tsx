					üëãüèæ Hey there, I&apos;m Shiva!
					<br /><br />
					I have {new Date().getFullYear() - 2022} years of experience in software development, as well as a Master&apos;s in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Workiva, Inc.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have been fascinated with automobiles since childhood, and it has always been my dream to enter this industry one day. I dream of a
					future in which vehicles are 100% safe for us, and
					sustainable for our grandchildren, without compromise on the pursuit of driving. While many may
					dismiss this vision as naive optimism, I would argue that we are

					my technical skills as a software engineer, so that I can one day also
					be a part of the revolution my inner child always dreamed of.
